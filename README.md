# Student-Dropout-Risk-Analysis
Using predictive analytics to identify students at risk of dropping out, leveraging academic, demographic, and financial data to inform early interventions
Educational institutions face challenges in identifying students who are at risk of dropping out. Predictive analytics can help identify patterns that lead to student dropout and allow timely intervention. This project aims to build a model that predicts the risk of a student dropping out based on various academic, demographic, and financial features.
